# Filtered_VCF
This directory contains information on the VCF files after quality filtering.

The filtered VCF files will also be stored in this directory after a full successful pipeline run.

The file [`snps.txt`](snps.txt) contains the count of SNVs in each VCF file of the dataset produced in our publication, which was used to generate the [`plot_4`](..\vcf_stats\plot_4.png) figure, corresponding to **Figure 1**.
